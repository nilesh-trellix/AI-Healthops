# Final Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed all unused file-based code and data folder as requested. The API now exclusively uses runtime data integration.

## Files Removed
- `data/` directory and all contents including `alert_1.json`

## Code Removed
- **graphql_api.py**: 
  - Entire `analyze_alert` mutation (100+ lines)
  - `Path` import dependency
  - File reading functionality
  - Updated environment variable loading to use `os.path` instead of `Path`

## Files Updated
- **test_client.py**: 
  - Removed file-based testing functions
  - Simplified to use only runtime data approach
  - Clean, focused testing with sample data

- **README.md**: 
  - Complete rewrite removing all references to data folder
  - Updated with runtime-only examples
  - Clean documentation focused on API integration
  - Removed sample data section

## Current State
✅ **Working**: Runtime integration via both REST and GraphQL  
✅ **Clean**: No unused code or files  
✅ **Documented**: Updated README with runtime examples  
✅ **Tested**: Verified both endpoints work correctly  

## API Endpoints Available
1. **REST API**: `POST /analyze-alert` - Direct JSON input
2. **GraphQL API**: `analyzeAlertData` mutation - Runtime data processing

## What Remains
- Core runtime functionality for both REST and GraphQL
- Vertex AI integration
- Jinja2 templating system
- Environment configuration
- Test clients for runtime integration
- Comprehensive documentation

The system is now clean, focused, and production-ready for runtime alert analysis.
