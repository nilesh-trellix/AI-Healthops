{
	"summary": "Process PID 5284 shows signs of being memory and I/O intensive, with low CPU utilization over the 120-second interval. The primary concern is the high peak memory usage, which reached over 187 MB for the working set and 194 MB for page file usage, suggesting a potential for performance bottlenecks under sustained load or on systems with limited memory.",
	"keyPoints": [
		{
			"label": "High Memory Usage",
			"details": "The process exhibited a significant memory footprint, with a peak working set size of 187,678,720 bytes and peak page file usage of 194,379,776 bytes. This level of memory consumption could impact overall system performance."
		},
		{
			"label": "Moderate I/O Activity",
			"details": "Over the interval, the process read a total of 28,167,472 bytes and wrote 17,931,511 bytes. While the IOPS are low (1 read, 10 write), the sustained data transfer indicates consistent disk activity."
		},
		{
			"label": "Low CPU Load",
			"details": "CPU usage was minimal, with only 1% user mode and 0% kernel mode utilization on average. This indicates the process is not computationally bound and spends most of its time waiting for I/O operations or managing memory."
		}
	],
	"recommendations": [
		{
			"label": "Investigate Memory Peaks",
			"details": "It is recommended to profile the application to understand the cause of the high peak memory usage. Continuous monitoring should be implemented to check for potential memory leaks over longer operational periods."
		},
		{
			"label": "Optimize Disk I/O",
			"details": "Analyze the process's disk access patterns. If large files are being read or written frequently, consider optimizing these operations through caching strategies or more efficient file handling to reduce potential I/O bottlenecks."

	"performanceProfile": [
		{
			"label": "Memory Intensive",
			"details": "The process is characterized by high memory allocation (peak working set size of 187 MB) and a significant number of page faults (188,480), with minimal CPU load (1% user time). This indicates its performance is primarily dependent on memory access speed and availability."
		}

	"resourceHotspots": [
		{
			"label": "Memory Allocation",
			"details": "The high number of page faults (188,480) combined with a large peak working set size (187,678,720 bytes) suggests the memory subsystem is the primary performance constraint for this process."
