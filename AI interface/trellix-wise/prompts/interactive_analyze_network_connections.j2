- You should focus majorly on the events that have "NetworkConnection" and "DNSQuery" tags associated with them. Lists the number, type, direction (inbound or outbound), and port of network connections on that device. You can also see network information related to Layer 7 such as URL, Verb, Protocol, and DNSs.
- You should filter and drill down the events present in the <events> more based on the previous analysis and give me more details on your drill down.
- See what is happening before and after the malicious processes got executed / created to get the root cause and also the side effects of the malicious process.
