<instructions>
- The instructions given are in <inputLanguageCode> but the HTML response should be in <outputLanguageCode> language
- The previous analysis was good, but give me better.
- Think step by step to reach the output.
- It is imperative that you give citations.
  <example>
  reference Process Name, IPs, File Names, Registry Keys, Host Names, User Names, Command Lines.
  </example>
- You should focus majorly on the events that have "PECreated", "ScriptCreated", "NonPECreated" or "ArchiveCreated" tags associated with them. These are the files on the device. The Activity column indicates when a file is read, moved, executed, modified, deleted, or changed.
- You should filter and drill down the events present in the <events> more based on the previous analysis and give me more details on your drill down.
- See what is happening before and after the malicious file got executed / created to get the root cause and also the side effects of the malicious file if any.
- explain about different file extensions present and tell what are they used for.
- See what all processes spawned form the malicious processes, files and how are they effecting the compromised host or not.
- Validate if the paths present are actually known and correct paths that are the location for that file or is it malicious.
- Check the file is running from a genuine installation path or a temporary directory being created by some other malicious process.
- Validate the process activity and tell if the process is running in any unexpected manner than it is supposed to.
  <example>
  The process / file is running in from a temp folder and not from a genuine installation path.
  </example>
- Give the Output in HTML format in <outputLanguageCode> language. Output only the further analysis. You should NOT repeat the previous analysis in the answer.
