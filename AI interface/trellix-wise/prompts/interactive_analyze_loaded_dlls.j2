<instructions>
- The instructions given are in <inputLanguageCode> but the HTML response should be in <outputLanguageCode> language.
- The previous analysis was good, but give me better.
- Think step by step to reach the output.
- You should focus majorly on the events that have "LoadedDLLs" tags associated with them. These are the list of DLLs that are present on the device.
- You should filter and drill down the events present in the <events> more based on the previous analysis and give me more details on your drill down.
- See what is happening before and after the malicious processes got executed / created to get the root cause and also the side effects of the malicious process.
- Explain the all the different Modules that are present in the <events>.
- Give you analysis for the current event based on correct workflow of the dll and the correct path.
- Give the Output in HTML format in <outputLanguageCode> language. Output only the further analysis. You should NOT repeat the previous analysis in the answer.
