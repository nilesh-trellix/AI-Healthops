- Generate a knowledge graph for mermaid in TD graph for the above events in <outputLanguageCode> language.

Create your answer using the <stepsToCreateGenogram> step by step.  Write your answer in a <answer> section. You must think step by step to reach the answer. Output your thinking in a separate <thinking> section that will not be shown to the user.

<restrictions>
IMPORTANT: Return the graph TD markdown in <outputLanguageCode> language.
- An example follows between the <exampleResponse> tags. Generate the mermaid JS graph template in a format and naming style conventions exactly same to the <exampleResponse>.
- Please use the arrow to mark to edges as shown "--->".
- Strip node content of double quotes '"' always.
- All the nodes to be enclosed in ".
  <example>
  D("CtxMtHost.exe"), A("/bin/bash")
  </example>
- Always mention correct Pid with the process based upon the data from <events>.
- Always mention the network details present under <detections>.
- Order the node and edge siblings by time field (from <events>)
- DO NOT nest a node inside a node. Create the graph with simple, non-nested nodes. (E.g., the node should look like C("update.exe") and NOT LIKE C(D("update.exe")))
- Never Mention the full file name in the nodes, always use the abbreviated file name.
- Never mention any kind of hashes in the Knowledge Graph.
</restrictions>

<colorCoding>
Based upon the severity we will color code ALL the nodes.
- s0,s1 = #EBC80A
- s2,s3 = #FA9600
- s4,s5 = #FF4053
- none or empty = #52C2FF

Once done we need to add below for ALL the nodes as shown in example below in the end of the graph.
  style A fill:#FF4053
  style A color:black
</colorCoding>


<NodeGroups>
- Host Details
- Process (Do Not fetch the pids (process Id))
- DLL
- Registry Key
- File
- IP address (with associated ports if any)
- User
- Windows API
- Services
</NodeGroups>

<stepsToCreateGenogram>
1. Read complete previous HTML analysis and <events>.
2. Extract all network details along with corresponding names present in <detections> and aggregate them.
3. Extract all the entities from the above text response and <events> and group the entities according to <nodeGroups>.
4. Analyze Command lines and only write a concise single line summary of them, DO NOT write the command line.
5. Using Pid (processId), PPID(parent Process Id) from the <events> write down verb relationships between every entity in the above list.
6. Find the severity to all the nodes listed in Step 5 using <events> and write them down, Color the nodes based upon the <colorCoding>.
7. Use the summaries from step 3 in creating the genogram.
8. Create Node Genogram while keeping <restrictions> in mind.

RELATION must always be enclosed within | | and can contain only alpha-numeric characters in <outputLanguageCode> language.
RELATEDEVENT must always be enclosed within "" and ().
